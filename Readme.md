# Elrond dApp boilerplate examples

This repo contains subfolders, each named after the framework in which it is built and the contract used as an example (<framework-type>-<contract-type>)

To install one of the examples, either use this repo and follow the readme instructions in each project, or use the Elrond IDE when this feature will be available (link below).

For more Smart Contract tutorials, [the documentation](https://docs.elrond.com/), plus [Elrond IDE](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Elrond.vscode-elrond-ide) - which is a frontend for erdpy - should be a good start.
